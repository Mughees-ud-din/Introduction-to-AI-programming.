# 📁 Lab Tasks

## Overview
This repository contains the **lab task** files for the Fall 2025 course: Introduction to AI Programming with Python. Each file corresponds to one lab and includes all tasks covered in that lab.

## Task List with Zenodo DOIs
- Lab 1 task was to install python etc.   
- [Lab 2 tasks](https://github.com/Mughees-ud-din/Intro-to-AI-programming-with-python-lab-tasks-fall-2025/blob/main/Lab%202%20tasks.ipynb)           [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17752654.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17752654)  
- [Lab 3 tasks](https://github.com/Mughees-ud-din/Intro-to-AI-programming-with-python-lab-tasks-fall-2025/blob/main/lab%203.ipynb)                   [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17842300.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17842300)

## Guidelines
- One notebook per lab containing all tasks  
- Problem statements should be written in Markdown, followed by the corresponding code solutions  
- Preserve outputs for verification  

## Notes
Few lab tasks are maintained in a separate repository because they are already archived with Zenodo DOIs and releases.
